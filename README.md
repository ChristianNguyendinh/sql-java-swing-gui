# WIP  
  
GUI interface to connect to and run queries on SQL (SQLite3 file for now) servers  
Require the Java SQLite JDBC to be DLed and added to classpath  
  
### TODO:  
Database config  
Custom Queries  
fix the sorting columns  
  
Stretch  
(have these run the query in the backgorund, but make changes to GUI's data directly without the slow process of re fetching the updated data as we do with the custom queries)  
Button that opens a new window for updating a row  
	- maybe include option to delete that row too?  
same for adding a row
