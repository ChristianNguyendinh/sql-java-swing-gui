# SQLite GUI with Java Swing  
  
GUI interface to connect to and run queries on SQL (SQLite3 file for now) DBs  
Requires the Java SQLite JDBC to be DLed and added to classpath  
  
### TODO:  
    
(have these run the query in the backgorund, but make changes to GUI's data directly without the slow process of re fetching the updated data as we do with the custom queries)  
Button that opens a new window for updating a row  
	- maybe include option to delete that row too?  
same for adding a row  
option do DC from database and change to new one without a full restart...
